# Points-Race

## How it Works
Gives you points based off how quickly you complete a race. To work in conjunction with another one of my plugins called Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard (https://github.com/RandomNerd01/Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard)



Configurable points system in config.yml

## In-Game
You have to download my Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard plugin. Then before '/race', admins have to '/startgame'. 



1) Using '/race' starts this plugin.



2) As usual, this plugin is to be used with Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard





3) Works for 2 different types of races. Lap-based (So go over the same point 3 times like MCC Ace Race) or Checkpoint-based(Go over different checkpoints that are not at the same area like MC Mayhem Rapid Racers)





4) After finishing race, Player Name and Position will be displayed in Chat. Points you get for finishing in that position will also show up in scoreboard.





5) At end of timer for minigame, top 5 players will be shown.




6) After game timer ends, admins have to do /main to add game points to main leaderboard points
